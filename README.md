# HM10 Bluetooth Serial iOS
This is a simple iOS 9/10 app that lets you communicate with a HM10 (or HM11 or similar) Bluetooth UART module. This way you can communicate from your iPhone/iPad with e.g. an Arduino.

## Original Project
This is a fork of [hoiberg/HM10-BluetoothSerial-iOS](https://github.com/hoiberg/HM10-BluetoothSerial-iOS). Thanks to hoiberg for sharing this nice project.
The original is available for free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hm10-bluetooth-serial/id1030454675?ls=1&mt=8).

The helper class for the bluetooth communication can also be found [here](https://github.com/hoiberg/SwiftBluetoothSerial).

A Pro version of the original project is also available on the App Store --> [HM10 Bluetooth Serial Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hm10-bluetooth-serial-pro/id1221924372?ls=1&mt=8).

It has a tonne more features to help debugging HM10 applications, and also supports creating custom buttons to send pre-set messages.
